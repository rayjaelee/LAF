					<h3> YOUR BUSINESS </h3>
					<p>
						Research confirms that hiring formerly incarcerated people is simply smart business. As a recent ACLU report indicates, "retention rates are higher, turnover is lower, and employees with criminal records are more loyal."  also relieves the strain on state and local budgets, as well as the burden placed on the taxpayer. Stable employment, which reduces re-arrests and re-incarceration, keeps prison costs down -- one Philadelphia study conducted concluded that employing even just 100 more formerly incarcerated individuals would lead to a $2 million reduction in the city's correctional costs.

				<div class = "your-community">
					<h3> YOUR COMMUNITY </h3>
					<p>
						According to a 2018 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), nearly 2.2 million adults were held in America's prisons and jails at the end of 2016. That means for every 100,000 people residing in the United States, approximately 655 of them were behind bars. Such a large portion of our population isn’t allowed to be an upstanding member society by the other proportion. This perpetuates the cycle of the previously incarcerated committing crimes to earn their daily bread. If you hire them, it will give them a second chance as well as make your community better by adding another hard working citizen.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "someones-life">
					<h3> SOMEONES LIFE </h3>
					<p>
						Everyone deserves a second chance. Imagine making one mistake and facing the consequences for the rest of your life even after you’ve served your time. The frustration to have ambition and drive and still not being able to provide for your family is unimagineable. In the interest of our fellow human beings and their well being, help them out!
